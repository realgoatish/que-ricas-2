# Que Ricas - Latin Flavors Made with Love

<br>

¡Bienvenidos! Welcome to Que Ricas, your neighborhood restaurant bringing together the rich traditions and bold, colorful tastes of Latin America. 

<br>

We cook everything from scratch - juicy empanadas, fluffy arepas, sizzling tacos, hearty Pabellón bowls, fresh salsas, and specials inspired by the season. And yes… our churros are just as good as they smell.

<br>

# We’re here for more than just good food - we’re here for good company. 

<br>

That’s why we choose fresh, quality ingredients, pack every to-go order with care, and treat everyone who walks through our doors like part of the family.

<br>

So pull up a chair, try something new (or stick with your favorite), and let us share a little taste of Latin America with you.
